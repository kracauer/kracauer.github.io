subtitle: Homework // L13 Social Network Analysis (SNA)

<b>Task:</b> <i>Create a network of places in the “Dispatch” — if places are mentioned in the same article, they must be connected one way or the other — we can use that as the basis for creating edges. Generate a vizualisation in Gephi, only here you will need to create a geographical network, i.e., a network put over a real map: use Geo Layout plugin (your file with the data on nodes must also include coordinates). Describe your observations on your website as a separate blog post.</i>

### 1. Python Code for Preparation of Data Set

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re
import os

newPathToFolder = "Folder were given files are located"
pathToFolder = "Folder for loop results"
listOfFiles = os.listdir(pathToFolder)

# function with one argument filter to define a specific date which will use values of the dispatch only if the date is true
def generate(filter):

    placeNames = []
    dicFreq = {}
    resultsCSV = []

    # for loop to access given files
    for f in listOfFiles:
        soup = BeautifulSoup (open(pathToFolder+f, "r", encoding="utf8"), features="html.parser")
        
        # searches for list items of "date" and gives a maximum of 2 elements
        # only returns the second match
        issue_date = soup.find_all("date", limit=2)[1] 
        issue_date = issue_date.get("value")
        
        # searches for all "div3" tags and stores it in the variable "articles"
        articles = soup.find_all("div3", type = True)
        if issue_date.startswith(filter):
            
            # for loop to count each article and combines it with the given date
            for a, item in enumerate(articles):
                counter = str(a) + "-" + str(issue_date)
                
                # finds all place names
                places = item.find_all("placename", key = True)
                
                # variable with counter
                article = "article-" + counter                                  
               
                # prints new value
                print(article)
                
                for a, item in enumerate(places):
                
                    # counter2 creates unique identifier
                    counter2 = str(a) + "-" + counter
                    
                    # for loop to retrieve all place names
                    place = item.get_text()
                    
                    # variable that holds the TGN number
                    key = item["key"].split(";")                                
                    
                    # prints processed places
                    print(str(place))
                    
                    # for loop to clean TGN numbers
                    for k in key:
                        key = [d for d in k if d.isdigit()]                     
                        tag_id = ''.join(key)
                        
                        # creates variable that holds results
                        placeList = "\t".join([counter2,issue_date,article,place,tag_id])
                        
                        # appends variable to the list
                        placeNames.append(placeList)                            

    # loop for frequency of place names
    for i in placeNames:                                                        
        if i in dicFreq:
            dicFreq[i] += 1
        else:
            dicFreq[i]  = 1

    # removes rare mentioned place names
    for key, value in dicFreq.items():                                          
            newVal = "%09d\t%s" % (value, key)
            resultsCSV.append(newVal)

    # assorts results
    resultsCSV = sorted(resultsCSV, reverse=True)                               
    
    # prints number in list
    print(len(resultsCSV)) 
    
    # joins results in CSV list line by line
    resultsToSave = "\n".join(resultsCSV)                                       

    # creates new target folder
    newfile = newPathToFolder  + "matched_list.csv"
    
    # creates header for the CSV list
    header = "freq\tid\tdate\tsource\ttarget\ttgn\n"
    
    # opens the file and writes each article into a seperate file
    with open(newfile, "w", encoding="utf8") as f8:
        f8.write(header+"".join(resultsToSave))

# brings all pieces together
generate("1860-11")
```

### 2. The Results of Preparation

Due to the long calculation time only the articles of the "Daily Dispatch" of the month November 1860 ("1860-11") were processed. For the calculation of this one month my computer already took 726 seconds, about 12 minutes.

After processing, the data set is available in the following form:

### 3. Visualization with Gephi

The same applies to Gephi as to most visualization programs: Without the right preparation of the data and without the right settings, you don't get scientific hints, only artistic artefacts. For example: A first attempt to display the data generated above.

<img src="/img/purely_artisticel.png"/>

In order to keep the ratio of input-out during the visualization as comprehensible as possible, we initially only use four parameters in the "Overview" field. 

<img src="/img/arbeitsbereiche_gephi.png"/>

Once we are familiar with the data set and its behavior within Gephi, more parameters can be applied. The parameters to start with are: Average Degree, Average Weighted Degree, Modularity and Eigenvector Centrality.

<img src="/img/settings_gephi_statistics.png"/>

For the layout type we select "Force Atlas 2" and the settings recommended by Maxim Romanov:

<img src="/img/recommended_setting_atlas_2.png"/>

The classes created by the "Modularity" command can be applied as colors to the data ball by selecting the following settings: Appearance --> Nodes --> Partition --> Modularity Class
Used correctly, they can significantly improve the clarity of the data.

In the last step we switch to the field "Preview". Here we apply the setting "Default Curved" under "Preview Settings". Due to the condensed form, we can see "Modularity Classes" even better.
