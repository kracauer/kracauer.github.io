<b>Task:</b> <i>Create a network of places in the “Dispatch” — if places are mentioned in the same article, they must be connected one way or the other — we can use that as the basis for creating edges. Generate a vizualisation in Gephi, only here you will need to create a geographical network, i.e., a network put over a real map: use Geo Layout plugin (your file with the data on nodes must also include coordinates). Describe your observations on your website as a separate blog post.</i>
