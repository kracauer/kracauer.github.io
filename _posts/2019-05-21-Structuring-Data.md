<b>Task 1:</b> <i>Reformatting the “Dispatch”: generate one TSV-file with the entire content of the “Dispatch”, where each article (or, more broadly—an entry) is a single record; each record should include:
  <ol>
  <li>date</li>
  <li>type of an entry (there are articles, advertisements, notices, etc.)</li>
  <li>header</li>
  <li>the text of an entry</li>
  </ol>
</i>
