title: Mapping Geographical Data

This post shows how the geographical data created in [Lesson 10](https://kracauer.github.io/2019-05-28-Text-to-Map-1/) can be displayed on a map using GQIS.

<b>Task 1:</b> <i>Add coordinates to those places (QGIS/python)</i><br>
<b>Task 2:</b> <i>Map them in QGIS, using frequencies to size the markers on the map</i>

### Solution 1: Merging tgn numbers with place id <!--TODO>

The following the has to be executed within the directory containting the given data.

```python
import re, os

# imports the previously generated TGN data into a dictionary and return the dictionary
def loadTGN(tgnTSV):
    # opens TSV file with TGN data
    with open(tgnTSV, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
        
        # reads file by each line
        data = f1.read().split("\n")

        # creates dictionary
        dic = {}

        # separated values are written into the dictionary
        for d in data:
            d = d.split("\t")
            dic[d[0]] = d
        return(dic)

# function matches TGN numbers from articles and TGN database
def match(freqFile, dicToMatch):
    
    # opens the TSV files
    with open(freqFile, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
        
        # splits lines and creates list
        data = f1.read().split("\n")

        # define lists and counter
        dataNew = []
        dataNewNA = []
        count = 0

        # loop starts with first set of data at index 1
        # (index 0 contains the key names)
        for d in data[1:]:
            
            # splits the line at the tabulator and reads
            # tgnID is at index 1
            tgnID = d.split("\t")[1]
            
            # freq is a index 0
            freq  = d.split("\t")[0]

            # matches TGN value in dictionary
            if tgnID in dicToMatch:
                val = "\t".join(dicToMatch[tgnID])
                val  = val + "\t" + freq

                # the TGN value can contain "NA" from previous formatting
                if "\tNA\t" in val:
                    # list for "NA" values
                    dataNewNA.append(val)
                else:
                    # list containing matches, but no fire hazard
                    dataNew.append(val)
            else:
                # counts the non matched TGN values
                count += 1

    # creates new TSV file
    # set key names for new TSV file
    header = "tgnID\tplacename\tlat\tlon\tfreq\n"

    # writes data into files
    with open("coord_"+freqFile, "w", encoding="utf8") as f9a:
        f9a.write(header + "\n".join(dataNew))

    # writes data into files
    with open("coord_NA_"+freqFile, "w", encoding="utf8") as f9b:
        f9b.write(header + "\n".join(dataNewNA))

    # prints the number of non matched TGN values
    print("%d item have not been matched..." % count)



# prepare dictionary
dictionary = loadTGN("tgn_data_light.tsv")

# brings all pieces together
match("dispatch_toponyms_1861.tsv", dictionary)
match("dispatch_toponyms_1862.tsv", dictionary)
match("dispatch_toponyms_1863.tsv", dictionary)
match("dispatch_toponyms_1864.tsv", dictionary)
match("dispatch_toponyms_1865.tsv", dictionary)
```








### Solution 2: Mapping using frequencies
