subtitle: Homework // L11 Text to Map (2/2)

This post shows how the geographical data created in [Lesson 10](https://kracauer.github.io/2019-05-28-Text-to-Map-1/) can be displayed on a map using GQIS.

<b>Task 1:</b> <i>Add coordinates to those places (QGIS/python)</i><br>
<b>Task 2:</b> <i>Map them in QGIS, using frequencies to size the markers on the map</i>

### Solution 1: Simple Mapping
Since in the TGN database the longitudes and latitudes are rounded up and down by default, the cities are distributed in a discrete grid on the map.
